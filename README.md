# Clean Angular Blog Template v2 ðŸ“°

An angular blog template forked off [brookton's template](https://github.com/brookton/clean-angular-blog-template)

## What is different?

I forked this repo to update it and to improve some functionalities, so I can use it as a personal template. 
Feel free to fork or contact me if there's something you think I should change.

## Technologies:

1. Angular 10 front-end
2. NodeJs back-end
3. Mongoose database  
(this MEANs you have to have npm, node, angular and mongoDB installed)


## Getting Started:

1. `git clone` to your local directory
2. cd `blog-front`
3. run `npm install`
4. in a new terminal cd `blog-back`
5. run `npm install`
6. run `npm start` on backend and frontend
